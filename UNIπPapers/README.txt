Adding view.

Creating the view is similar to creating the visual experience for the user.
The canvas is where the tastefully displayed info is found. We take pleasure in the creative part of this stage,
making sure the user has an aesthetically beautiful and intuitive interface in addition to receiving the information they require.

Adding model

Building the model feels like building the application's backbone. It's where we store the logic 
for manipulating and retrieving data. We found delight in building a sturdy structure that protects data integrity
and acts as the system's base.

creating database
The further step is creating the database for the project
Connecting the program to a database is similarly to allocating memory for the system. 
It is the location where the program stores and retrieves data. We view it as offering the application a
mechanism to retain and recall facts, producing a more dynamic and meaningful experience for the user.

Time:     1545
adding controllers.
Implementing controller actions feels like creating a dance between the user interface and the underlying data.
It's where I make judgments about how the application handles user input. Balancing this dance is critical for providing a 
seamless and responsive user experience.

more user-friendly and efficient.
