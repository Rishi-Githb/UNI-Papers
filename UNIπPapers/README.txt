Adding view.

Creating the view is similar to creating the visual experience for the user.
The canvas is where the tastefully displayed info is found. We take pleasure in the creative part of this stage,
making sure the user has an aesthetically beautiful and intuitive interface in addition to receiving the information they require.

Task6
Date:     2024-02-18
Time:     1420
Adding Model

Building the model feels like building the application's backbone. It's where we store the logic 
for manipulating and retrieving data. We found delight in building a sturdy structure that protects data integrity
and acts as the system's base.

Task7

Time:     1500
Creating Database
The further step is creating the database for the project
Connecting the program to a database is similarly to allocating memory for the system. 
It is the location where the program stores and retrieves data. We view it as offering the application a
mechanism to retain and recall facts, producing a more dynamic and meaningful experience for the user.

Task8
Date:     2024-02-18
Time:     1545
Adding Controllers.
Implementing controller actions feels like creating a dance between the user interface and the underlying data.
It's where I make judgments about how the application handles user input. Balancing this dance is critical for providing a 
seamless and responsive user experience.

Task9
Date:      2024-02-18
Time:      1650
Adding View.
Introducing search functionality is important. It's like giving consumers a magnifying glass to
explore and find exactly what they're looking for. We notice a sense of improvement in use, making the program
more user-friendly and efficient.

Roadblocks
We faced couple of errors while performing the tasks and we fixed the errors. We could'nt fix some errors such as sql database.

As we initially faced with some issues so we gathered at a place and did the job in one Laptop, but later on we have solved and did some work again
in different laptops.
